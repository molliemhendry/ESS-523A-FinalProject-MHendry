# Background: Fern Lake

### Fern Lake is an alpine lake that lies within the boundary of Rocky Mountain National Park. It has been known to be affected by two recent wildfires, one of small size in 2012, and one of significant size in 2020, the East Troublesome fire. The East Troublesome fire was started near Troublesome Pass, CO and grew to a size of 193,812 acres in less than 2 months. The fire is the second largest in Colorado state history. 

### As a student within the Graduate Degree Program in Ecology, part of my degree requirements include working on ecological research under an advisor affiliated with the university. My advisor, Dr. Jill Baron, was tasked by the National Park Service to understand the impacts of the East Troublesome fire on Fern Lake. I will be assisting her with this research. We have received preliminary data recently from Fern Lake sampling conducted over the past three years. Sampling frequency was limited due to funding, so the statistical significance of our findings is somewhat limited as a result. However, we can still use this information to understand some of the fundamental direct impacts of the fire on Fern Lake. 

### Samples were collected from three locations within the lake. The lake outlet, center lake surface, and center lake hypolimnion (deep water, aphotic and often anoxic).

# Plotting metric changes over time by location

## Dissolved Organic Nitrogen:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(fern, aes(x = date, y = DON)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis() +
  facet_wrap(~location, scales = "free")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue")

```

### Dissolved organic nitrogen decreased at all locations post-fire. 

## Conductivity
